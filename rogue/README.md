# ldmx rogue

Working files for LDMX's DAQ using Rogue.

## Warning
I would like to emphasize two points.

1. Personally, I am unfamiliar with front-end DAQ in general and Rogue specifically.
2. The front-end firmware and hardware is also in development.

Both of these points mean that this repository is most certainly **not** stable.
